    "\n",
    "Compelled to grow and propelled to be mainstream, predictive technology is a commonplace and affects everyone everyday. It impacts our expectations as we drive, eat, shop, vote, see a doctor, communicate, watch television, listen to music, borrow oe even steal. Making such predictions poses a tough challenge. Each prediction depends on various factors. And to keep all these factors we have data, which is considered as the most potent unnatural resource of the modern society.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of predictive modeling here was to identify the factors that demonstrated significant statistical correlations with House Prices. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was collected and made available to public by <b>Dean De Cock</b>. \n",
    "[1]This dataset is inspired from the Boston Housing dataset which had only 506 datapoints with 14 variables and it served as a great predictive model project to work on. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory\n",
    "variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values. \n",
    "\n",
    ">#### Details of the population selected for building predictive model\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset has information of house details and prices of sales of houses from year the 2006 to year the 2010 in Ames, Iowa in The United States of America. The house prices vary for same type of house in each city or town and hence knowing more about Ames was very important.[2] Ames is a city located in the central part of Story County, Iowa, with an area of 23.5 sq miles. The historical city had an population of 59,000 in 2010 with 84.3% white population. Ames is home of Iowa State University of Science and Technology, a public land-grant and space-grant research university which employees 15,500 people in the city. It has 37% lower crime rate thaan the national average and a pleasant weather through the year. The city has lower median earning compared to the national average and on the same hand, 16% lower unemployement rate than the national average.\n",

    ">The author of the dataset, Dean De Cock, suggested a similar predictive model in his paper. Observing the linear relation between living area and the sale price in the dataset I decided on work on the linear model with houses having areas less than 2500 square feet for my first model. Total Area of the house, according to me plays the most important role in deciding the sale price. <br>\n",

    "><p>Linear regression in simple term allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous variables(dependent and independent). The equation for simple linear regression is written as:</p>\n",

    "\n",
    ">where Y is the dependent variable which can be deteremined by independent variable X and coefficient b. The coefficient tells us how a unit change in X affects the unit change in Y. <br> I have tried to understand the linear relation between living area and Sale Price. \n",

Leaf node (e.g., Hours Played) represents a decision on the numerical target. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node.

    "\n",
    "<p>The prediction models built in this project utilised certain factors of the house and the location. It can be said from the models that sale prices are highly influenced by the area of the house, the basement area and the number of cars that can be accomodated in the housing. These proved to be most influencial as the model attained 67% accuracy right with these three factors. The other factors like neighborhood, house and building type followed in the influencial factors list.The best model observed 81% accuracy on cross validation score which according to me has a scope of improvement.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> A software version of the project can help the marketers predict the prices just on few selected factors used here. This project does not have modern data, which means the changes in neighborhood, building and house type preference over the period of 2010 - 2018 could have changed and can give us lower accuracy. If Ames had observed great economic growth over the period the model would need more data to learn and improve the model for better predictions.  </p>\n",
