    "Like other types of assets, the price of real estate is determined by the observed and unobserved attributes of the asset. Houses exhibit unobserved heterogeneity across various dimensions. Same sized bedrooms can be valued differently depending on the location of the window. The topography of same sized lots can affect the value of the property.Neighborhood amenities, like nearby schools and parks, are important determinants of property prices. While no two houses in general are alike, houses have been priced based on what appraisers or brokers refer to as comparables, observationally similar houses that were recently\n",
    "sold in the same or nearby neighborhood. Pricing adjustments are made to reflect the differences between the house of interest and the comparable houses. In other words, the price of a house takes into account the price information of other houses.\n",

    "The data set describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values. \n",

    "\n",
    "When we start working on a predictive model, the <b>first step</b> should always be understanding the business objective. Here, in general, the Predictive analysis of house prices helps us in increasing customer experiences, understanding market and also financial modeling. <b>Second step,</b> how will this model help in understanding the market in a long term? I aim to built the model such that adding data to it can help predicting the house prices at any given time (given that, the data belongs to one city). I will also focus on understanding some unobserved features that impact the Sale price of the house. <b>Third step,</b> selecting data for modeling; here, I have a dataset to work on with all the related attributes impacting the sale price of the house. <b>Fourth step,</b> preparing the data. Data we collect is usually not the correct format and has many missing values, we have to perform initial analysis to know the data and remove discrepancies by transforming variables and values. <b>Fifth step,</b> model selection and training model. (from the results obtained, we can further alter the model to built a more robust and scalable model) <b>Sixth step,</b> validating the model we can score and predict the test sample and also compare the accuracy of various models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> Here, I have worked on generating the hypothesis (this might lead to leaving back some variables that should be taken into consideration and hence, I read a few articles on Zillow and trulia to guide me through and take the best factors that can impact the Sale Prices of the house.)\n",

    "When we try to predict the price of the house, the first most important factor is the location of the house; the location includes, Country, State and the city. Here, since we are refering to only Ames in Iowa, I have reffered to various real estate and crime data sites to understand the demographics, weather, income and crimes in Ames.\n",

    "What influences the Sale Prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major factors influencing the house prices according to me are:\n",
    "1.  The geographic location of the house, taking the granularity of zip codes for geographic location\n",
    "2.  The neighbourhood of the house\n",
    "3.  The number of bedrooms, bathrooms and balcony \n",
    "4.  The area of the house\n",
    "5.  Number of floors\n",
    "6.  Parking and basement area\n",
    "7.  Furnished or unfurnished\n",
    "8.  Year of construction\n",
    "9.  Utilities in the house\n",
    "10. The amenities near to the house (school, parks, etc)\n",

    "I have referred to Zillow Analysis 2016 and compared it to the analysis generated from the data set. I have used tableau to perform basic exploratory data analysis.\n",

    "## Comparing the dataset with my generated hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We can draw the following data points from the dataset according to my hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 1. Geographic location: \n",
    ">The geographic location accroding to the hypothesis can be taken up with the Historic town of Ames, Iowa\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 2. Neighbourhood:\n",
    ">The nieghbourhood gives us details like the location in the city/town. The <i>neighbourhood</i> factor in the dataset provides us with the information we aim to focus on and <i>Zoning classification</i> adds more information to the data of neighbourhood. \n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 3. Number of bedrooms, bathrooms and Balcony:\n",
    ">The number of bedrooms, bathrooms and balcony can be determined in the dataset from the data points <i>Full Bath, Bedrooms, Halfbath</i>. More the number of rooms with the increased surface area, more the sale price of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 4. The area of the house\n",
    ">Area of the house includes the area of all the floors, garage and backyard or frontyard. The data points determining these values are <i>Garage Area, Firstfloor square feet, secondfloor square feet, wood porch area, enclosed porch area, open porch area, screen porch, pool area</i>\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 5. Number of floors\n",
    ">Number of floors allows privacy and hence is being preffered\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 6. Parking and basement area\n",
    ">The area of parking and basement area have been incuded in the total area\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 7. Furnished and unfurnished\n",
    ">This feature determines whether the bedrooms are furnished with beds and neccessary furniture or not. The dataset does not describe this feature\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 8. Year of construction\n",
    ">The data point <i>YearBuilt and Garage YearBuilt</i> determines the year in which the house was built. This overall affects the sales price of the house\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### 9. Utilities\n",
    ">Utilities in the dataset includes points: <i>Heating system, electrical system, central air, number of fireplace and utilities</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the first generated hypotesis, I will perform the analysis and built a predictive model. \n",
